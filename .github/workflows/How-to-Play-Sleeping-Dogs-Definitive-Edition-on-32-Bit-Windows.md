Fortunately, there is a way to play Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition on 32 bit Windows, thanks to a crack released by Codex. A crack is a modified version of the game's executable file that bypasses the copy protection and allows the game to run without a valid license. Codex's crack also enables the game to run on 32 bit systems by removing some unnecessary files and functions.
 
To use the crack, you need to download it from a reliable source, such as MegaGames[^1^]. The file name is SLEEPING.DOGS.DE.V1.0.ALL.CODEX.NODVD.ZIP and it is about 350 KB in size. You also need to have the original game installed on your computer, either from Steam or from another source. The game size is about 20 GB.
 
Once you have downloaded the crack, you need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will find a folder named CODEX inside the zip file. Inside this folder, you will see a file named SleepingDogsDefinitiveEdition.exe. This is the cracked executable file that you need to copy and paste into your game installation folder, replacing the original file. The default location of the game folder is C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SleepingDogsDefinitiveEdition.
 
After you have replaced the original file with the cracked one, you can launch the game by double-clicking on SleepingDogsDefinitiveEdition.exe. You should be able to play the game on your 32 bit Windows without any problems. However, you may experience some performance issues or bugs due to the reduced functionality of the crack. You may also need to block the game from accessing the internet using your firewall, as Codex advises in their release notes.
